===============================

##1. Starting a Game

To start a game, simply open `index.html` in your browser.

(You'll need JavaScript enabled for the game to work.)

##2. The Goal

The goal is to reach the blue sea (repeatedly).

Once you've proved, convincingly, that you can reach the sea, ... who knows?

##3. Controlling the Player

Your character is controlled using the arrow keys (<kbd>&uarr;</kbd>,<kbd>&darr;</kbd>,<kbd>&larr;</kbd>,<kbd>&rarr;</kbd>).

##4. Enemies

Enemy bugs are patrolling between you and your goal! Avoid the bugs or lose a life.

The enemies spawn with a random speed setting on a random row. Be careful!

##5. Lives and Points

You start with five (5) lives. Each contact with an enemy bug will reset your position and reduce your lives by one (1). Once you have zero lives, it's GAME OVER!

You start with 0 gems and must earn 10 to win.

##6. Restarting

If you win all the gems or lose all your lives, you will be presented with an option to restart by pressing <kbd>Y</kbd>.

Of course, you can always restart instantly by refreshing the page.


Enjoy!
